# Stanford Machine Learning

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises for the [Stanford Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on Coursera. The solutions all use [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/).

I haven't always followed the exercise sheets exactly, since I wanted to branch out and experiment with the content. I've also named and organised the files in this repository independently of the way the exercises were numbered.
